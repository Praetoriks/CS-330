1. How do I approach designing software?
* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
* What design process did you follow for your project work?
* How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing software in the same way I approach any problem. I start by attempting to figure out what everyone knows, so that I can have the foundational knowledge, before attempting it on my own, that way I can skip some of the early mistakes and learn how to deal with the harder bits. This project helped me craft a better 3D model in my brain of how coordinate systems function in OpenGl and how the simpler bits can be manipulated to create greater wholes. The tactics I've used here will be applied in future work because it is the way the I approach problems on a fundamental level.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
* What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
* How did iteration factor into your development?
* How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I approach developing programs as a computer scientist, in the way that I think any scientist approaches a problem. You create a hypothesis, or a method that you think may be successful, and you test and implement until you eventually reach a place where the product succeeds or fails. If it fails, you start over and try again until you reach success. Iteration factored strongly into this project as there was no way for me to see the progress being made in real time without building out the program and seeing the results of my work. My approach to developing code did evolve throughout the milestones as watching the provided videos taught me that there are just certain ways that work better when it comes to OpenGL and likely any system I will be working with in the future.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science will help me in reaching my goals by allowing me to figure out solutions to the problems plaguing the world of computer science, whether it be small incremental improvements for a large corporation or in the pursuit of something completely new. The work matters because it makes the world, as it is today, exist in the fashion that it does. This aspect of computer science will help me both in the educational and professional pathways by giving me a foundation into the world of displayed visual data and objects, the way in which most anyone will interact with a produced product.
